    "The InPhO Topic Explorer features a powerful interactive coding environment that enables direct manipulation of the corpus and models, in contrast to the web visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the `vsm notebook` command, several things happen:\n",
    "1.  The Topic Explorer creates a new folder called `notebooks` and places several files inside it:\n",
    "     -  **corpus.py** contains Python code which imports the Corpus object and a function that will load models trained on your corpus. It gathers this information from your `CORPUS.ini` file, where `CORPUS` is the name of the folder you prepared. More information on this special file is below.\n",
    "     -  **Topic Explorer Tutorial.ipynb** is this file, which provides the skeleton documentation for interacting with the models.\n",
    "     -  Other **ipynb** files, containing analyses that can be re-run on your own corpora.\n",
    "2.  The Topic Explorer launches a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). This allows you to program in Python on your local computer using the browser, rather than a terminal or other program. "

If you open a new tab or browser window and type in `localhost:8888` you will open the same list of files and be able to edit multiple files at once. Note that editing the same file in multiple tabs may cause you to accidentally overwrite your data. Jupyter does not check if the file is already open.\n",
