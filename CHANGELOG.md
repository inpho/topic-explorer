# CHANGELOG

To find the version running on your machine use the command `topicexplorer version`. In older releases, this was `vsm version` or `vsm --version`.

Not all beta releases are documented below. We give the summary of all changes between major stable milestones. If you are using a beta version not listed below, we highly recommend switching to one listed below or simply updating using `topicexplorer update`.

This project follows the [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) versioning conventions. See [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for justification. The only difference between PEP 440 and SemVer.org is the pre-release format **1.0b20** vs. 1.0-beta.20.

This CHANGELOG follows the conventions at [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/). Versions should group changes in the order: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security` (see section ["What makes a good change log?"](http://keepachangelog.com/)).
